## Version [0.5.0] Beta (2021-11-11)

2. The `Charity-Sent` transaction type has been changed from a normal disposal (same as a `Gift-Sent`) to being a "*No Gain/No Loss*" disposal, the same as a `Gift-Spouse`. If you have used this transaction type previously we recommend you re-generate your tax reports as you may have overpaid capital gains tax.

3. The ExchangeRatesAPI and RatesAPI data sources are no longer available. Please update your `bittytax.conf` file to use the new BittyTaxAPI as shown below, this file resides in your .bittytax folder within your home directory.

```
