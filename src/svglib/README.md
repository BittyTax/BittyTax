# Spoofed svglib

This is a minimal implementation of `svglib` that provides just enough functionality for `xhtml2pdf` to work without requiring the full svglib package.

The official svglib has many dependant packages, including `pycairo` which requires compilation, and installation of `cairo`.

This is a headache for users, especially when the PDF reports generated by BittyTax do not contain any SVG files.
